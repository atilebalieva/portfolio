   //The program asks to enter a number with a input box. If the entered number:
   // -Lower than the random number, an alert is shown with text “Lower” and the input box is shown again. 
   // -Bigger than the random number, an alert is shown with text “Bigger” and the input box is shown again. 
   // -Equals to the random number, an alert is shown with text “Correct”. No input box is shown.
